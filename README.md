DAOLite
=======

A generic & lite DAO for Android



Description
===========
You can use for your Android projects ORMLite, GreenDAO or another ORM. You 
can make your own DAOs or your SQL queries.
If you do not need the powerful of an ORM and you have no time to waste 
creating your own DAOs, this is your solution.

In all the projects we have worked required at least this level of development. 
For a basic project that will be enough. 

The module does not use reflectivity so massive, only a few calls in order 
to be much more efficient than models with reflectivity. Neither requires 
extending an abstract class so that your models can be as complex as you want.

The main classes are:
* GenericDAO, the DAO headers.
* GenericDaoImpl, the DAO implementation.
* DBEntity, interface to implement your models.
