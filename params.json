You \r\ncan make your own DAOs or your SQL queries.\r\nIf you do not need the powerful of an ORM and you have no time to waste \r\ncreating your own DAOs, this is your solution.\r\n\r\nIn all the projects we have worked required at least this level of development. \r\nFor a basic project that will be enough. \r\n\r\nThe module does not use reflectivity so massive, only a few calls in order \r\nto be much more efficient than models with reflectivity. Neither requires \r\nextending an abstract class so that your models can be as complex as you want.\r\n\r\nThe main classes are:\r\n* GenericDAO, the DAO headers.\r\n* GenericDaoImpl, the DAO implementation.\r\n* DBEntity, interface to implement in your models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\nYou have the [JavaDoc](https://github.com/r2bapps/DAOLite/blob/master/GenericDAOLite/doc/javadoc) files on doc/javadoc directory, \r\nand [UML](https://github.com/r2bapps/DAOLite/blob/master/GenericDAOLite/doc/uml) diagrams on doc/uml directory.\r\n\r\nClass diagram\r\n-------------\r\n![Class diagram](https://github.com/r2bapps/DAOLite/blob/master/GenericDAOLite/doc/uml/ClassDiagram.png?raw=true \"Class diagram\")\r\n\r\nSample model diagram\r\n--------------------\r\n![Sample model diagram](https://github.com/r2bapps/DAOLite/blob/master/GenericDAOLite/doc/uml/BusinessModelDiagram.png?raw=true \"Sample model diagram\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nAny help or comment to improve this model to make it more simple to understand \r\nor obtain a better performance will be gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by\r\n============\r\nR2B Apps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 R2B Apps\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
